# Hash Tables for Organization
As I know the Hash table in Swift is Dictionary Type. It's a key value pairs data type which is useful for many scenarios. We can use key to find the specific value. For example the political candidates and the number of votes each receives.
Another example is common HTTP status, we can define a function and return the meaning of the status code.
```
func statusCode(_ code: Int) -> String? {
  switch code {
    case 200:
    return "OK"
    case 301:
    return "Moved Permanently"
    case 401:
    return "Unauthorized"
    case 404:
    return "Not Found"
    case 500:
    return "Internal Server Error"
    default:
    return nil
  }
}
```
